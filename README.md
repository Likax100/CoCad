# CoCad
 A collaborative, real-time 3D solid surface modeling/editing software.

# Some Background
 This was my final year university project and contribution to the world of additive manufacturing (3D printing).

 *Note: This project is about 80% complete, all the main functions are there except some extra features such as the chat box and bidirectional model data transfer (currently changes are reflected to everyone based on host model edits - that will change soon however)*
